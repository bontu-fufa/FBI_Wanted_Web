Of the six victims, only one survived the attack.  On January 18, 1991, a local arrest warrant was issued for Pham by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Suffolk County, after he was indicted by a grand jury in Suffolk County Superior Court on five counts of murder, one count of armed assault with intent to murder, one count of conspiracy, and one count of carrying a firearm without a license.  </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Following the massacre, Pham went to New York City, New York, and boarded a flight to Hong Kong on February 1, 1991.
